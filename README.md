HTML forms are essential for user interaction on websites, allowing data submission.
Forms are created using the `<form>` tag, specifying where data will be sent with the `action` attribute.
Choose the appropriate HTTP method (`GET` or `POST`) using the `method` attribute in the `<form>` tag.
Create text input fields with `<input type="text">` tags within the form.
Checkboxes are created using `<input type="checkbox">` tags, enabling multiple selections.
Radio buttons, generated with `<input type="radio">` tags, allow single selections from a group.
Dropdown menus can be added using the `<select>` and `<option>` tags.
Enable multi-line text input with the `<textarea>` tag within the form.
Use `<button>` tags to create clickable buttons for form submission or other actions.
Add helpful descriptions to form elements using the `<label>` tag.
The `required` attribute makes specific fields mandatory for form completion.
Employ the `placeholder` attribute to provide hints or example text within input fields.
Group related elements together using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags.
Collect various data types by including multiple `<input>` tags within the `<form>` tag.
Customize autocomplete behavior with the `autocomplete` attribute set to "on" or "off".
Limit input length by defining the maximum characters allowed with the `maxlength` attribute.
